# FIT-BachelorThesis

This repo contains my bachelor thesis' code and final pdf.


## Publications and conferences database - PubConf

PubConf is a web application, that is used to store information about publications and conferences. It is used internally by staff and PhD students at Faculty of Information Technology at Czech Technical University in Prague.

The application is built using PHP (Nette framework), with HTML, CSS and Javascript (Bootstrap and jQuery frameworks) on the front end.

This application was built and maintained during the span of several bachelor and master theses and several authors. My contributions include:
- user interface updates, in order to make the app easier to use for users
- publication search update, with multiple new options for filtering results
- Nette upgrade
- bug fixing (crashes, slow loading)
- code maintenance
- and other smaller improvements
